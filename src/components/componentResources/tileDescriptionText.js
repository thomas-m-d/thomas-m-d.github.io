    Invited Contribution to an Edited Volume

    Abstract: We argue that although a pragmatist account of knowledge avoids
    some common forms of skepticism it also comes with three significant costs.

    Invited Contribution to a Magazine

    Coauthors: Robert B. Talisse, Scott Aikin
    <br />
    <br />
    Abstract: We argue that a pragmatist account of linguistic (non-)sense
    dissolves a worry that naturalism (i.e. the view that the sciences are
    authoritative over philosophy) is self-defeating.

    Abstract: I argue that naturalism (i.e. the view that the sciences are
    authoritative over philosophy) and global expressivism (i.e. the view that
    all language expresses inner mental states instead of representing external
    reality) are inconsistent with one another.

    Abstract: I argue that moral intuition and moral principles are each
    insufficient on their own to justify moral judgments. Instead, we justify
    such judgments by letting intuitions and principles supplement one another
    in a process known as reflective equilibrium.

    <br />
    Abstract: I argue that a logical paradox is true, and that this is
    unproblematic on a pragmatist account of knowledge which emphasizes both the
    role that inquiry plays in producing knowledge and the role that hope plays
    in guiding inquiry.
